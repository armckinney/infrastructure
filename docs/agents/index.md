The following instruction files are available:

- None

## System Message

You are working with a containerized development environment repository. Always reference the instruction files in `docs/agents/context/` before making changes. Follow the established patterns for Dockerfiles, build scripts, and CI/CD workflows.

## Key Principles

1. **Instructions First**: Always consult the relevant instruction files before making changes
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established patterns for Dockerfiles, build scripts, and workflows
3. **Single Source of Truth**: The `docs/agents/context/` directory contains the authoritative information
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Only use search or bash commands when encountering unexpected information that doesn't match the instructions
